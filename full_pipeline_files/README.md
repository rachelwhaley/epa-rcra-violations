To run the full pipeline: `python3 ???`

Pipeline workflow: -> is this still up to date?

- Clean the data:
- Splits data into training and testing sets: `new_pipe.py`
- Generates Features: `has_violation.py`
- Evaluates Models: `model_analyzer.py`
- Runs Models: `new_pipe.py`
- Returns list of facilities ordered by score from model:
